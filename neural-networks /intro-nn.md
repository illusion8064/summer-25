Understanding Neural Networks (digit recognition example)

1. Introduction to Neural Networks
     - neural networks are fundamental in machine learning and ai.
     - they enable computers to analyze data, recognize patterns, and make predictions or decisions.
     - these networks learn from data, adjusting their internal connections (weights) to improve accuracy.
     - perform tasks like image recognition or language translation.

2. Basic Structure
   - neurons:
     - simplified as units holding a number between 0 and 1 (activation).
     - activation indicates the neuron’s response to input.
   - input layer:
     - 784 neurons (for 28x28 pixel images).
     - each neuron corresponds to a pixel’s grayscale value (0=black, 1=white).
   - output layer:
     - 10 neurons, each representing a digit (0-9).
     - activation indicates the network’s confidence in each digit.
     - the neuron with the highest activation determines the predicted digit.
   - hidden layers:
     - intermediate layers (eg: 2 layers with 16 neurons each).
     - process features and patterns.
     - their role is to transform input into meaningful representations.

3. How Neural Networks Process Data
   - layer-to-layer activation:
     - activations in one layer determine the next layer’s activations.
   - pattern recognition:
     - hidden layers may detect subcomponents like edges, loops, lines.
     - eg: recognizing a loop or a line as part of a digit.
   - hierarchical abstraction:
     - from pixels to edges, then to shapes, then to digits.

4. Mathematical Operations in Neural Networks
   - weights:
     - numbers assigned to connections between neurons.
     - positive weights increase activation; negative weights decrease it.
   - weighted sum:
     - compute sum of input activations multiplied by their weights.
   - bias:
     - an additional number added to the weighted sum.
     - shifts the activation threshold.
   - activation function:
     - sigmoid function:
       - maps the weighted sum to a value between 0 and 1.
       - helps determine neuron activation.
     - relu function (rectified linear unit):
       - modern alternative to sigmoid.
       - outputs zero if input is negative; linear if positive.
       - easier to train in deep networks.

5. Parameters and Complexity
   - weights and biases:
     - These are essentially the knobs the network adjusts during learning.
   - representing the network:
     - using matrices (weights) and vectors (activations, biases).
   - network as a function:
     - input: 784 numbers (pixels).
     - output: 10 numbers (digit probabilities).

6. Learning in Neural Networks
     - the network learns optimal weights from data.
     - uses training data (images with known labels).
     - this enables the network to recognize complex patterns.
     - improves accuracy over time.

7. Why Layered Structures Are Useful
   - decomposition of recognition tasks:
     - recognize simple features (edges, lines).
     - combine features into patterns (loops, shapes).
     - recognize digits based on feature combinations.
   - analogies:
     - speech recognition: sounds → syllables → words → phrases.
     - image recognition: pixels → edges → shapes → objects.
