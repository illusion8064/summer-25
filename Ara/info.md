Ara is a RISC-V vector unit developed by the PULP project.

There is some [this](https://chipyard.readthedocs.io/en/1.12.3/Generators/Ara.html) other doc of chipyard, which tells about some configuration in [file](https://github.com/ucb-bar/chipyard/blob/1.12.3/generators/chipyard/src/main/scala/config/AraConfigs.scala).
